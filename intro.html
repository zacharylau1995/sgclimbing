            <h2>An Introduction to Climbing in Singapore</h2>
            <p class="lead mt-4">Climbing is a fun sport that challenges both your body and your mind. It boasts a wide variety of types, with a wide scale of difficulties, making it accessible to almost everyone. Climbing in Singapore mainly revolves around indoor climbing, of which the 3 most popular types are illustrated below. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">Bouldering is a form of rope-less climbing on walls typically around 4.5m high. The surrounding floor area is padded so that climbers can land safely, even from the top of the wall. It used to be a form of training for roped climbing but has gained popularity that some climbers purely boulder, as it can be really intense and there's no need for additional equipment like a rope or harness. </p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Top Rope</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Top Rope is a form of roped climbing where the rope is pre-attached to an anchor point at the top of the route prior to the start of the ascent. The rope is controlled by a belayer on the ground, or by an auto-belay device that replaces the need for a belayer. It is a good stepping stone for more advanced lead climbing. </p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Lead</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Lead climbing is a more advanced form of roped climbing where the climber connects to higher anchor points along the route as they ascend it. Conventionally, lead climbing was done when anchors were not accessible by any means other than climbing, and one lead climber had to climb and establish the route with protection equipment (thus the name "lead"). Nowadays in indoor climbing gyms, the protection equipment like quickdraws are provided by the gym, and the style of clipping and climbing is generally referred to as lead / sport climbing. </p>
